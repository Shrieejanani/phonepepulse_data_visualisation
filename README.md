# phonepepulse_data_visualisation

Project Title : Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration: A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly

[DEMO LINK](http://localhost:8501/)

Technologies : Github Cloning, Python, Pandas, MySQL, mysql-connector-python, Streamlit, and Plotly.

Domain : Fintech

Problem Statement:

The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.

Steps involved in the project:

Data Extraction: • Cloned the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it locally

Data Transformation: • Extracted the required data in NoSQL format and subsequently converted the extracted data to pandas dataframe

Database Insertion: • Writing the dataframe into the MYSQL table

Dashboard creation: • Using the Streamlit and Plotly/Seaborn libraries in Python created an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Used the Plotly's built-in geo map functions to display the data on a Indian map • Created user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.

Data retrieval: • Querying the relevant table in MYSQL database and loaded the data into pandas dataframe

Data exploration and visualization: • Used Plotly/Seaborn libraries to accomplish the task

Deployment: • Ensured the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Tested the solution thoroughly and deployed the dashboard publicly, making it accessible to users

The code is written in python , database used is MYSQL and UI is developed using streamlit.

Packages used in the project: Pandas, Json, Streamlit, Plotly, MYSQL
